Possible future stuff
================
Post "Moved to $new account" note from old account
Import contacts from file
README that doesnt suck
Sync more than two accounts
Subcommand 'auth' to authorize pumpmigrate with account, store credentials and exit
Check for bad account IDs (strip newlines and spaces?)
set protocol based on pypump data, currently defaults to https for getting following list, possible problem if pump server only support http
