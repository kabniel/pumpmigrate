## Usage

PumpMigrate has three subcommands, `move`, `sync` and `load`

To move contacts between two accounts, run:
	pumpmigrate.py move

To sync contacts for two accounts, run:
	pumpmigrate.py sync

To load contacts from file, run:
	pumpmigrate.py load my_contacts.json

When an account is first used with PumpMigrate,
it will ask you for permission to use that account.

For more help, run:
	pumpmigrate.py subcommand --help

### Examples

#### Move contacts

user@pump1 is following foo and user@pump2 is following bar.
	pumpmigrate.py move -a user@pump1 user@pump2
user@pump1 is not following anyone, and user@pump2 is following foo and bar.

#### Copy contacts

user@pump1 is following foo and user@pump2 is following bar.
	pumpmigrate.py move -a user@pump1 user@pump2 --no-unfollow
user@pump1 is still following foo, and user@pump2 is following foo and bar.

#### Sync contacts

user@pump1 is following foo and user@pump2 is following bar.
	pumpmigrate.py sync -a user@pump1 user@pump2
user@pump1 and user@pump2 are now both following foo and bar.

#### Load contacts
	pumpmigrate.py load -a user@pump my_contacts.json
File contents should be in the format of:
	["user@pump1", "anotheruser@pump2"]
