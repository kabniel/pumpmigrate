Usage
=====
Run with ./pumpmigrate.py

Account credentials are stored in ~/.config/pumpmigrate/config.json
'Following' backups are stored in ~/.cache/pumpmigrate/


Dependencies
===========

PumpMigrate works with:

- Python (tested with 2.7)
- requests-oauthlib 0.3.0+
- requests 1.2.0+
- PyPump https://github.com/xray7224/PyPump/ (PyPump is also available on pypi but currently not up to date)
    pumpmigrate looks for pypump in its own directory,
    i am personally using a pypump -> path/to/PyPump/pypump symlink,
    i'm open to suggestions on how to solve this better.
