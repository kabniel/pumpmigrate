Project page:	<https://gitorious.org/pumpmigrate>
Git repo:	<https://git.gitorious.org/pumpmigrate/pumpmigrate.git>

## Usage

PumpMigrate has two subcommands, `move` and `sync`

To move contacts between two accounts, run:
	pumpmigrate.py move

To sync contacts for two accounts, run:
	pumpmigrate.py sync

When an account is first used with PumpMigrate,
it will ask you for permission to use that account.

For more help, run:
	pumpmigrate.py subcommand --help

### Examples

#### Move contacts

user@pump1 is following foo and user@pump2 is following bar.
	pumpmigrate.py move -a user@pump1 user@pump2
user@pump1 is not following anyone, and user@pump2 is following foo and bar.

#### Copy contacts

user@pump1 is following foo and user@pump2 is following bar.
	pumpmigrate.py move -a user@pump1 user@pump2 --no-unfollow
user@pump1 is still following foo, and user@pump2 is following foo and bar.

#### Sync contacts

user@pump1 is following foo and user@pump2 is following bar.
	pumpmigrate.py sync -a user@pump1 user@pump2
user@pump1 and user@pump2 are now both following foo and bar.
